This is a second project from the course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp".
The task is to build your own portfolio website.

I used Flask and built this portfolio page in html.
I didn't include the images of my certificates as they have my personal data on them.
Please see the screenshots below of how the final page looks like.

Feel free to advise how to improve the code.

Thanks!
