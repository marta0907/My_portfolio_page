This is a second project from the course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp".
The task is to build your own portfolio website.

I used Flask and built this portfolio page in html.

Please see the screenshots below of how the final page looks like.

If anyone would be willing to help me improve this code I would be very greatful.

Thanks!

Update: now improved to mobile version as well and added video for the main page.
